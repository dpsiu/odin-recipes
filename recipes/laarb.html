    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Laarb is a dish from Thailand that incorporates fish sauce, lime, and herbs like shallots, 
        mint, cilantro, and more, to bring out an intense flavor.</p>
    <p> In this recipe, we choose to use pork, while you may use beef, although the flavor profile
         may change a lot.</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon uncooked rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar (preferrably palm sugar)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 lime (medium sized, juiced)</li>
        <li>1 red chili (sliced, preferrably thai chili)</li>
        <li>3 shallots (peeled, thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>3 scallions (chopped)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mint</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a dry wok or pan over low heat, toast the rice grains, stirring continuously until 
            they turn golden and fragrant––about 10 minutes. Grind to a coarse powder in a mortar & pestle. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place your wok back over high heat until smoking. Add the oil and the ground pork. 
            Stir-fry until the pork is browned, and add in the toasted rice powder, sugar, fish sauce, and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry for another minute, and then add in the chili, shallots, scallions, cilantro,
             and mint. Stir-fry for one more minute, and then taste for seasoning, adding more chili, 
             sugar, fish sauce, and/or lime juice to your taste if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve with sticky rice, steamed jasmine rice, and/or lettuce leaves.</li>
    </ol>
