    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're like me, you also drink water. In fact, if it breathes, grows, or reproduces, it also likely drinks water.</p>
    <p>This recipe is so delicious and necessary, I guarantee you can't go a week without it!</p>
    <p>To make measuring out the tiny quantities of minerals needed easier on you, we recommend first making a concentrated "electrolyte solution" 
        and then adding just 10g (10mL or 2 tsp) of that solution to 1 L of distilled or otherwise purified water.</p>

    <p>Calcium chloride is available from most homebrew or winemaking shops. Magnesium chloride is 
        available as a dietary supplement. Go for the liquid form if possible; solid pills may contain bulking agents such as calcium.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 liters distilled or purified water, divided</li>
        <li>1.5g magnesium chloride (see notes)</li>
        <li>1g sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)</li>
        <li>1g calcium chloride (see notes)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 liter water, magnesium chloride, baking soda, and calcium chloride in a large
             bottle or jug and stir to dissolve to form electrolyte solution.</li>
        <li>Add 10 grams of the electrolyte concentrate to remaining 1 liter of water to dilute. Serve or use for cocktails. 
            Remaining electrolyte solution can be stored in a sealed container for future dilution.</li>
    </ol>
